The tsv-files contain the German metaphor detection data originally gathered by Köper & Schulte im Walde (2017, https://aclanthology.org/W17-1903.pdf). The data was reduced and balanced for the purposes of the current study.

The Latin metaphor detection data that was gathered by Logos for the American Standard Version of the bible (https://de.logos.com) was translated into Latin for the current study. It is not included in this repository, since it is based on a commercial software. For those interested in the dataset, please contact me: anna.huelsing@uni-hildesheim.de.

The dictionaries contain translations needed for the random forest classifier. The translations were generated with the Word2Word library by Choe et al. (2020, https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.371).
