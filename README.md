# MD_crosslingual
4 different models for performing metaphor detection cross-lingually for low-resource languages.

To do:
1. Download the English basic training dataset and Russian test data from Tsvetkov et al. (2014) and move it into folder "data": https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/#publications (see link "DATA" belonging to paper "Metaphor Detection with Cross-Lingual Model Transfer")
2. Change to the directory "Preprocessing" and run: PYTHON PREPROCESS.PY. By doing this, the basic training dataset and the Russian test dataset are preprocessed and saved as tsv-files in the directory "data/tsvs". If other files than the Russian dataset should be used, they need to be saved in this directory and have the same format as the preprocessed Russian dataset.
3.
